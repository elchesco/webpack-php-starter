# webpack-php-starter
simple starter kit for working with PHP and webpack.

# features

* PHP for handling any server-side necessities like security, OAuth, etc.
* Webpack for bundling the assets of your app into the page
* a handy `index.php` to be used as a router if required
* configurable via `config.php`

# getting started

* `git clone https://github.com/wazoomedia/webpack-php-starter.git`
* `npm install` or `yarn install`

# running the local server

* `npm start` or `yarn start`
* open your browser to `http://localhost:8000/` and you should see green - `When the light is green, trap is clean.`

# development work

TODO - I want to log some more handy "basic" `npm` and/or `php` bits that help you move faster.
